# Crypto Portfolio

This repo contains 3 separate code bases that use the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) to retrieve the current values of your coins. It's meant for education purposes only - **these are by no means a complete/tested product**.

## Usage

You'll need to update a JSON array with the coin symbols you want and the units you have. After the apps run, the current dollar value and the total will be displayed.

### Getting the symbols

To get all available coin symbols for your portfolio, go to [this API response](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/list) and search for your coins.

### Portfolio structure

```json
[
  {
    "coin": "bitcoin",
    "units": 1.123
  },
  {
    "coin": "ethereum",

  {
